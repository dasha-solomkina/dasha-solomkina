## Hi, I'm Dasha ðŸ‘‹
I am a frontend software developer with a diverse background in RevOps, consulting, marketing, and sales. My journey into programming began when my team solved a months-long business problem with just a few lines of code, sparking my fascination with web development. 

I currently work as a junior front-end developer at Birdie and am studying Node.js and Express to become a full-stack developer.
